# HiddenEye
Reborn of Famous Phising Tool HiddenEye

HiddenEye is a famous phising tool that contains a lot of phising  pages. But it will be not maintained anymore due to its errors and bugs.

With its latest original version it doesn't run for me .(https://github.com/DarkSecDevelopers/HiddenEye-Legacy#httpsgithubcomopen-security-group-osghiddeneyereborn)

## With this mod you can run HiddenEye in termux without any error .

Features

1.Root permission removed.

2.Auto update removed.

3.Ngrok added . (no need to download)

4.change the settings of localhost. (working 100%)

5.Fixed location web pages . (reverse connection is working 100%)

Still Ngrok and Localhost are working.

other tunneling features will be fixed with future updates.
